## Adding POS Integration Library to project

You can include this library into your Android project by adding first the JitPack repository to your root build.gradle

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Next, add the dependency to your app-level build.gradle

Development:

```groovy
dependencies {
    [...]
    // CM|PayPlaza Android POS Integration library
    implementation 'com.github.cmdotcom.android-pos-integration-sdk-kotlin:androidposintegrationsdk-debug:<version-tag>'
}
```

Production:

```groovy
dependencies {
    [...]
    // CM|PayPlaza Android POS Integration library
    implementation 'com.github.cmdotcom.android-pos-integration-sdk-kotlin:androidposintegrationsdk:<version-tag>'
}
```

Also you can download the desired .aar file from [releases](https://github.com/cmdotcom/android-pos-integration-sdk-kotlin/releases) and include it in your project:

```groovy
dependencies {
    [...]
    // CM|PayPlaza Android POS Integration library
    implementation files('lib/<aar_file_name>')
}
```

After this dependency is included, you can start using functionality contained in this library to perform operations in CM|PayPlaza environment.

See file in [doc folder](https://github.com/cmdotcom/android-pos-integration-sdk-kotlin/tree/main/doc) in this project for more information on how to work with this library.

Also an [example](https://github.com/cmdotcom/sunmi-ecr-example-kotlin) of how to implement the Integration SDK is available.
